# **Git:**

**Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS)** used to **track changes** in **source code** during **software development**.

It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, manage versions of files, and collaborate efficiently without overwriting each other’s work.





**git init:** is the command used to initialize a new Git repository.

**git status:** it shows you the current state of your working directory and staging area.

&nbsp; It helps you see:

\- Which files have been modified

\- Which files are staged for the next commit

\- Which files are untracked (not yet added to Git)

\- Which branch you’re currently on



**git status** → verbose, beginner-friendly explanation

* Full, detailed view
* Explains everything in plain English
* Helpful for beginners
* Shows branch info, hints, and instructions

**git status -s / git status --short** → concise, quick overview for advanced users

* Short, compact summary
* Ideal for experienced users or quick checks

Uses symbols to show the file state instead of sentences
